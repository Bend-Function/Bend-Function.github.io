# A Concert Review

This is the first time I want to a concert by myself. The title for the concert called

_Anime Piano Concert From Butter-Fly to I love you in Natsume's -- I wanna say 'I love you' loudly_ 

## First thought

When I viewed shops at Bilibili videos website in May 2022, I found there were two concerts about anime music that would be held in a few month in my hometown Hangzhou. One is on 10th July and the other is on 2nd October. I booked my first IELTS exam on 17th June, so I will have plenty of free time to watch the concert in July. 

## Context

This concert is a single piano performence and it has lots of popular music from anime I watched. My favourite part is about music in Your lie in April. It is the most sorrowful anime I've ever seen because I cried severval times when I watched it for the first time. I fell into a deep depression after that. Now I just want to watch it again however I haven't any courage to face to any frame in it. 

## Invitation

I invited two of my best friends, but unfortunately they all rejected my invitation.
One doesn't like to join public activities and the other one has to accompany his girlfriend at night.

## Booking

In the evening of 5th July, after I received the last rejection from my friend, I decided to go to the concert by myself. I opened DAMAI APP and tried to book a seat for me. Finally, I choosed a good seat in the middle part of the theatre. I anticipated it has a good view(actually is). The concert would held at 19:30 10th July in Hangzhou theatre where is not far from my home. I only need approximate 40 minutes to take bus to there.

## Before went out

I was very struggling in what T-shirt I have to wear. The Spy-Family one or Minecraft one or anyother? I tried to ask my friend and he told me that wear anything you want at the first time. Therefore I decided to wear the T-shirt with Spy-Family pattern to go.

After dinner the concert only had 80 min to go. I took my bag include a blank folder which I wanted to store the ticket and went out.

## On the way

I took my earphone from my car and bought a bottle of water from shop under my home. Then cross the intersection to take No.156 bus to theatre.

On the way to theatre I tried to finish my daily plan about learning 30 new words. However one of my best friend asked me a math problem about sequence on the half way. I really hadn't to deal with math problems for a long time but I still keeped coding habit especially in algorithum. So I quickly had an idea to solve it and I sent my idea to her but unfortunately she still didn't solve that however she knew that I was on the way to enjoy a concert and told me that she can do other things at first also wished me would have a wonderful evening in the theatre.

Finally I got off bus at 18:50.

## Took ticket 

I still remembered about 8 years ago, we had to quene for ticket. But now we merely need to scan a QRcode under a machine and tickets will printed automatically.

A man asked me he wanted to buy my ticket however I had not any tickets left I just bought one for me. I asked him for how much if I bought a ticket from him. He told me that his tickets had 30% discount(but I thought the position would really bad).

## Find seat

My seat was in Row 15, No. 20. The seating arrangement of the theatre is unusual. No.1 seats of each row are in the middle and seats which have odd number are on the left side even number seats are on the right side.

Finally I found my seat and after serval times I realized that I sandwiched between two couples.

## Begin

When the lights went out people stoped talking and closed their phone's screen. A pianoist came out without said anything. After bowing and applause he played "Swordland" directly. 

After performanced he introduced himself and told the reason why he is a substitute. His opening was very relax even if he misunderstood the letter 目 as 日.

## First half of concert

In this part, there were many my favourite music like "secret base" from "The flower we saw that day" and a series music from "You lie in April". I almost cried when I heard that. I remembered I always listen "secret base" after working on the way to dorm in school. 

At the end of semester of year 2 I always got up at 8 AM and went to lab to study. In the evening, I usually cross the woods near the lake and listening "Secret Base" to my dorm. These days was the most hardly period in my life and I am very satisfied myself because I really leart a lot during these days even just myself in the lab. Also I was not to choose to play video games or get up at noon like most of classmates. Although I was very tired these days and nobody accompanied with me, the feeling during that days is wonderful. I had a lot of things I really want to do. That's the life I desire for.
