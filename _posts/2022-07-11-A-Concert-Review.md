# A Concert Review

This is the first time I had an idea about going to a concert by myself. The title of the concert called

_Anime Piano Concert From Butter-Fly to I love you in Natsume's -- I wanna say 'I love you' loudly_ 


## First thought

When I viewed shops at Bilibili videos website in May 2022, I found there were two concerts about anime music that would be held in a few months in my hometown, Hangzhou. One is on 10th July and the other is on 2nd October. I booked my first IELTS exam on 17th June, so I will have plenty of free time to watch the concert in July. 


## Context

This concert is a single piano performance and it has lots of popular music from anime I watched. My favorite part is the music in "Your lie in April". It is the most sorrowful anime I've ever seen because I cried several times when I watched it for the first time. I fell into a deep depression after that. Now I just want to watch it again however I haven't any courage to face to any frame in it. 


## Invitation

I invited two of my best friends, but unfortunately they all rejected my invitation.

One doesn't like to join public activities and the other one has to accompany his girlfriend at night.


## Booking

In the evening of 5th July, after I received the last rejection from my friend, I decided to go to the concert by myself. I opened DAMAI APP and tried to book a seat for me. Finally, I chose a good seat in the middle part of the theater. I thought it had a good view (actually is). The concert would held at 19:30 10th July in Hangzhou theater, which is not far from my home. I only need approximately 40 minutes to take the bus to get there.


## Before went out

I was really struggling with what T-shirt I had to wear. The Spy-Family one or Minecraft one or any other? I tried to ask my friend and he told me that wear anything you want the first time. Therefore, I decided to wear the T-shirt with Spy-Family pattern to go.

After dinner, the concert only had 80 min to go. I took my bag, including a blank folder which I wanted to store the ticket and went out.


## On the way

I took my earphones from my car and bought a bottle of water from a shop under my home. Then cross the intersection to take the No.156 bus to the theater.

On the way to the theater I tried to finish my daily plan of learning 30 new words. However, one of my best friends asked me a math problem about sequence on the halfway. I really hadn't dealt with math problems for a long time, but I still kept my coding habit, especially in algorithms. So I quickly had an idea to solve it and I sent my idea to her but unfortunately she still didn't solve that however she knew that I was on the way to enjoy a concert and told me that she can do other things at first also wished me would have a wonderful evening in the theater.

Finally, I got off the bus at 18:50.


## Took ticket 

I still remembered about 8 years ago, we had to queue for tickets. But now we merely need to scan a QRcode in a machine and tickets will be printed automatically.

A man asked me that he wanted to buy my ticket. However, I hadn't any tickets left. I just bought one for me. I asked him how much if I bought a ticket from him. He told me that his tickets had a 30% discount (but I thought the position would really bad).

I tried to find a list for the concert but they did't prepare it for audiences.


## Find seat

My seat was in Row 15, No. 20. The seating arrangement of the theater is unusual. No.1 seats of each row are in the middle and seats which have odd numbers are on the left side even number seats are on the right side.

Finally, I found my seat, and after a few moments, I realized I was sandwiched between two couples.


## Begin

When the lights went out, people stopped talking and closed their phone's screen. A pianist came out without saying anything. After bowing and applause, he played "Swordland" directly. 

After the first music, he introduced himself and told the reason why he is a substitute. His opening was very relaxed even if he misunderstood the letter 目 as 日.


## First half of concert

In this part, there were many of my favorite music, like "secret base" from "The flower we saw that day" and a series music from "You lie in April". I almost cried when I heard that. I remembered I always listen "secret base" after working on the way to my dorm in school. 

At the end of semester of year 2, I always got up at 8 AM and went to the lab to study. In the evening, I usually cross the woods near the lake and listen to "Secret Base" on the way to my dorm. These days were the most hardly period in my life and I am very satisfied myself because I really learnt a lot during these days, even just myself in the lab. Also, I did not choose to play video games all day or get up at noon like most of my classmates. Although I was very tired these days and nobody accompanied me, the feeling during those days was wonderful. I had a lot of things I really wanted to do and had learned a lot of new skills. That's the life I desire.


## Second half of concert

The first music that began in the second half part was the Twelve Variations on "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman" by Mozart. This piano composition appeared in "Your Lie in April" many times. The pianist let audiences create a wechat group during the performance to find new friends, especially single people. Also, audiences can rise and swing phones which turn on the flash light following the tune. Unfortunately, I failed to join in the Wechat group because I turned off Wi-fi(Wechat based on it to locate you). 

By the way, using this music to meet someone who will be your boyfriend or girlfriend is really weird. Because it is from "Your Lie in April", which is a tragedy, the main character passed at the end of the story.

The music which got the most reactive was "I love you" from "Natsume's Book of Friends". After the singer and pianist stopped their performance, the audience gave them the thunder of applause.


## After the end

After the last music in the list palyed, the pianist said "It's the last music in the list" and exited from the stage. The applause went from loud to tepid. I thought most of the audience didn't know if they kept applauding they would get other extra music performances. So I kept applauding and then much audience returned to applaud with me. About 10 seconds later, the pianist came back and played "summer" because of the hot weather in Hangzhou, he said. Then he also played "Theme of Mitsuha" from "Your Name", which is one of my favorite anime movies. Finally, an unknown-named song was sung by the singer as the last music for the concert.

Everyone applauded when the concert ended. The pianist and singer also received flowers in the end.



## On the way home

I chose to take the metro back to my home. And had finished my daily study plan on the train.
