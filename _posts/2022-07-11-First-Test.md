# An Concert Review

```
Anime Piano Concert From Butter-Fly to I love you in Natsume's Book of Friends -- I wanna say 'I love you' loudly 
```

## First thought
When I viewed shops at Bilibili videos website in May 2022, I found there were two concerts about anime music that would be held in a few month in my hometown Hangzhou. One is on 10th July and the other is on 2nd October. I booked my first IELTS exam on 17th June, so I will have plenty of free time to watch the concert in July. 

## Context
This concert has lots of popular music from many anime. My favourite part is about music in Your lie in April. It is the most sorrowful anime I've ever seen because I cried severval times when I watched it for the first time. I fell into a deep depression after that and I even watched some episodes in the end. Now I haven't any courage to watch it again. 

## Invitation
I invited two of my best friends, but unfortunately they all rejected my invitation.
One doesn't like to join public activities and the other one has to accompany his girlfriend at night.

## Booking
In the evening of 5th July, after I received the last rejection from my friend, I decided to go to the concert by myself. I opened DAMAI APP and tried to book a seat for me. Finally, I choosed a good seat in the middle part of the theatre. I anticipated it has a good view(actually is).
