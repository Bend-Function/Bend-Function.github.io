_I prefer to watch comedy on YouTube, like "Last Week Tonight" and "Night Night Show with Brian". But I haven't seen a comedy offline_


## Idea

In July 2022, I joined a anime concert alone. For that I installed a new APP to buy ticket online and I found that there were many comedy shows in Hangzhou with low prices. Such as open-mic in workday evening which just cost 40 RMB each person. 

I tried to inveite my friends to there with me.

## Invitation & Plan
I tried thousand times to persuade a friend who is afraid to attend public activities. Finally, he approved my request at 14th July. I decided to book two seats at that day's evening in Hangzhou Grand Theatre which near the QianTang river and city balcony.

We planned that we can have dinner at KFC because that day were Thursday KFC had a good discount. We decided to take metro to citizen center at 18.30 and went to the nearest KFC to have dinner. Then walked to the Hangzhou Grand Theatre before 19.20.
